We are targeting the best use of Polygon ID prize for Polygon.

Polygon ID was essential for our smart contract wallet with the feature of rejecting ownership by an anonymous group vote. In real world settings, voting against an exisiting leader can have real-world consequences if the votes are not anonymous. The idea of anonymous on-chain voting is a very important use case enabled by PolygonID and ZKPs and has the potential to protect voters while maintaing web3 decentralization and composability.
